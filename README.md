# MalduinoW
A MalduinoW (or any malduino product) BadUSB Payloads Repository. Add your own scripts, make some, or browse for something new.

The MalduinoW is a new take on the BadUSB market, offering your standard BadUSB capabilities, but adding wireless capabilities. Remotely execute, edit, download, and delete scripts with the simple online user interface.

The basics of BadUSB script can be found here: https://docs.maltronics.com/badusb-scripting/the-basics

Note: I am not affiliated with Maltronics in any way. This is a mere collection of helpful or fun payloads for the Malduino series of BadUSBs.

Also, I am not liable for any damages you may or may not cause with these payloads. That is your choice to use the Malduino, which is sold as a tool, in a bad way. Tools can be used for good, or bad. Choose wisely.

Currently WIP.
