# A BadUSB Payloads Repository.
Add your own scripts, make some, or browse for something new.
Made specifically for the Malduino and MalduinoW, but should work with most badUSB/Rubber Ducky types.

The MalduinoW is a new take on the BadUSB market, offering your standard BadUSB operations, but adding wireless capabilities. Remotely execute, edit, download, and delete scripts with the simple online user interface.
Links on the MalduinoW to learn more: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/qs9gERSV-bY), [Maltronics Website](https://maltronics.com/collections/malduinos/products/malduino-w)

Note: I am not affiliated with Maltronics in any way. This is a mere collection of helpful or fun payloads for the Malduino series of BadUSBs.

Also, I am not liable for any damages you may or may not cause with these payloads. The scripts provided are purely for an experimental and educational purpose. Only test on your own hardware or on hardware you have explicit permission to run these on. Malduinos (and any type of badUSB) are sold as a legitimate tool, and tools can be used for good, or bad. Choose wisely.
